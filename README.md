# SITmud

This blast from the past is courtesy of my undergraduate days at Stevens Tech.  One of the projects for my Internetworking at TCP/IP class was to produce an application that made use of sockets.  Of cource I decided to make a simple MUD.

Essentially what we have is a glorified chat program.  You can move around, pick up objects, and even fight the occasional wandering monster.  I'll expand it as time allows.  Maybe even host an instance locally to mess around.
