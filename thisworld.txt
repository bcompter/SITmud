[Eldimroth, West Road]
This corner of the town smells of hot cinder and ore.  A haze of soot hovers in the air eminating from the Blacksmith's shop.  A few apprentices hurredly atttend to the bellows or retrieve raw materials for the furnace.  The sound of the Master's mallet strinking the anvil drowns out all other noise.

A line of personal homes and cottages dot this section of town.  The stones in the road are cracked and unkept, seemingly covered in soot.  The townsfolk don't seem to mind, and carry on about their buisiness seemingly unaware of the dirty conditions.

This corner of town is quieter than most sections so near the center.  As such, a host of more extravagant homes line a much neater street.  The signs of prosperity are immeadiatly visible in the dress and gait of the local redidents.

[Eldimroth, East Road]
The tall spires of the town temple rise above all other structures around it.  The frame is set in grey stone of local origin.  The same stone can be seen in the streets throughout, but these stones bear a significant difference.  They are clean and more expertly carved.  Reverent followers come to and fro, asking the gods for redemption.

Soldiers used to occupy this outpost to prevent kobolds from advancing on Eldimroth. No soldiers remain and the outpost has been destroyed. However, it does not appear to have been the work of kobolds. To the north, the trail continues. There is no trail to the east, but the smell of meat on an open fire lingers through the trees.
